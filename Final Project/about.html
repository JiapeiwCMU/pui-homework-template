                <p class="intro-main">Photos in this gallery were taken using Fujifilm X-S10. As the first professional camera I bought, I’ve taken it with me on many trips and daily photo shoots. After taking so many photos, I think it’s important to organize them into albums and keep the memories of the trips alive.</p>
